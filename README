Hotkey control for Gigabyte Tweak Launcher

1. Download gtlcontrol.exe and gtlcontrol.ini.

2. Make sure Gigabyte Tweak Launcher is installed.

3. Edit gtlcontrol.ini to set your bclk, voltage and multiplier.

4. There are 3 options for each hotkey "multienable", "voltenable" and "bclkenable". If you want to enable any of the 3 options set the value to 1, setting the value to 0 disables the respective option.

For example,

multienable=1 enables the multiplier.
multienable=0 disables the multiplier.

NOTE: Every time you edit gtlcontrol.ini you need to exit and reload gtlcontrol.exe.

5. To use the application, first start Gigabyte Tweak Launcher and then open gtlcontrol.exe.

6. Your hotkeys f1 through to f4 will execute the options you set in gtlcontrol.ini.



NOTES:
The options in the [debug] sections are for debugging, you dont need to touch them.

You may want to disable the teamau splash screen, to do this set title=0

If you dont trust binaries, the source is provided in gtlcontrol.au3, it is written in the autoit scripting language.
